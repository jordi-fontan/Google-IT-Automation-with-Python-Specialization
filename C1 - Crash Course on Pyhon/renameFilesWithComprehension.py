# Question 1
# Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. 
# To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. 
# Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
## list2=["+ve" if i>0 else "-ve" for i in list1]
## obj = ["Even" if i%2==0 else "Odd" for i in range(10)]
newfilenames = [ f  if f[-3:]!='hpp' else f[0:-2] for f in filenames ]  

print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
